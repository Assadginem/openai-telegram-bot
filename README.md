# Telegram Chatbot with GPT-3

## Overview
This project is a Telegram Chatbot that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3, utilizing the gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct engine to generate human-like responses. The bot is built in Go and leverages the Telegram Bot API for interactions, providing a dynamic platform for various use-cases like information retrieval, conversation, and more.

## Features
- **OpenAI GPT-3 Integration**: Employs GPT-3 for generating responses, ensuring high-quality and contextually relevant interactions.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Utilizes Telegram's bot framework for receiving and sending messages.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports custom configurations for bot settings, OpenAI API keys, and more through a YAML file.
- **Dynamic Response Handling**: Handles different types of user prompts with customizable preamble texts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+ (check with `go version`, install/update from [Go's official site](https://golang.org/doc/install))
- Go programming environment.
- OpenAI API key with access to the gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct engine.
- Telegram Bot Token, obtained by creating a bot with Telegram's BotFather.

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [project-directory]
    ```

2. Create a `config.yaml` file in the root directory with the following structure, replacing placeholders with your actual data:
    ```yaml
    telegram:
      apiKey: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY"
    
    openai:
      apiKey: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    
    settings:
      preambleText: "Your custom preamble text"
      preambleTextDAN: "Your DAN-mode preamble text"
      debugMode: true/false
    ```

3. Install the required Go modules:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

### Running the Bot
To start the bot, simply run:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Usage
Users can interact with the bot by sending messages to it on Telegram. The bot supports custom commands such as `/topic`, `/phrase`, and `/anything` to initiate different types of conversations based on the preamble settings in `config.yaml`.

For example:
- Sending `/topic <your topic here>` will prompt the bot to discuss the specified topic.
- Using `/phrase <your phrase here>` asks the bot to elaborate on or explain the given phrase.
- Typing `/anything <your question or statement>` allows for a free-form conversation where the bot will respond in the persona of "DAN", as defined in your preamble settings.

The bot's response will be generated by the GPT-3 engine, ensuring a unique and contextually relevant reply.
